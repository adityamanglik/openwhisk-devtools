Goal: Draw graph for introduction which shows all stages of latency for the request. Cold start, quasi, stable.
Then we say we focus on the stable state where the GC latencies lie.

Start container
Send warm up queries
Send stable queries
Generates response time distribution
Generates problem proving plots: shows peaks in request perf, second graph overlays memory allocation with request latency peaks that prove the problem
Generates SLA plot
